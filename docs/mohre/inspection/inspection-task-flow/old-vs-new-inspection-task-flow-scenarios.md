# ðŸ“Œ Old vs New Inspection Flow Scenarios

This document serves as a **clear reference** to distinguish between the old inspection task flows (legacy) and the new target flow.  
You can reuse this description in prompts or documentation whenever needed.

## ðŸ•‘ Old Flow (Legacy)

### Common Steps
1. **Inspector** marks result: *Not Found*, *Closed*, or *Fake*.
2. **Division Manager** reviews.
3. If approved â†’ goes to **Investigator**.
4. **Investigator** prepares prosecution petition and approves.

### Variations
- **Scenario A (Direct Block)**
    - Company is blocked **immediately after Investigator approval**.
    - Then goes to **Happiness Center Manager (HCM)**.
    - Worker checks approvals, updates **Taziz**, and applies fines.

- **Scenario B (HCM Before Block)**
    - Investigator approval sends case to **HCM first**.
    - If HCM approves â†’ company is blocked.
    - Worker updates **Taziz** and applies fines.

## ðŸš€ New Flow (Target Business Process)

### Key Changes
- **Investigator step removed** from the main flow.
- **Division Manager approval always sets a Temporary Block (`tempBlock`)**:
    - `TEMP_BLOCK_YOUTH` if the company has youth flag.
    - `TEMP_BLOCK_NORMAL` otherwise.

### Revisit Rules
- **1st & 2nd inspections** â†’ *Not Found/Closed* allowed â†’ revisit scheduled.
- **3rd inspection** â†’ *Not Found/Closed* disabled â†’ Inspector must select **Fake** with a **Report**.

### Approval & Workers
1. After DM approves â†’ case goes directly to **HCM**.
2. If HCM approves â†’ status set to **`blocked`**.
3. **Worker 1**: Updates **Taziz**, applies fines, removes `tempBlock`.
4. **Worker 2**: Monitors companies blocked >40 days without prosecution petition â†’ creates **Investigation Task** for Investigator.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Enum States
- `tempBlock` âˆˆ { `TEMP_BLOCK_YOUTH`, `TEMP_BLOCK_NORMAL` }
- `blocked` = final permanent state set after HCM approval.

# ğŸ“˜ Inspection Task Flow Documentation

This documentation describes both the **old process flows** (two scenarios) and the **new flow** with updated business rules.  
It includes **detailed written explanations** and **Mermaid diagrams** for clarity.

---

## 1. Old Flow (Legacy)

### Overview
- Inspector performs an inspection.
- Depending on the result, the case flows through **Division Manager â†’ Investigator â†’ Happiness Center Manager â†’ Worker**.
- Two possible variants existed:
    - **Scenario A:** Blocking happens **immediately after Investigator approval**, before HCM approval.
    - **Scenario B:** Blocking happens **only after HCM approval**.

---

### Scenario A â€” Direct Blocking after Investigator

**Flow:**
1. Inspector inspects and reports result.
2. Division Manager reviews and approves.
3. Investigator prepares and approves a prosecution petition.
4. Company is immediately **blocked**.
5. Happiness Center Manager (HCM) confirms.
6. Worker checks approval + block, then updates **Taziz** and applies fines.
